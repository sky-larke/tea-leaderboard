For legal purposes, this involves no gambling. People are given 5 dayi neipiaos per signup. They are permitted to do 'faith actions' to indicate their faith in the success of individuals in contests. If their faith is proven, they will gain a proportionate amount of dayi neipiaos when the contest ends. If it fell short, the ones sacrificed will be forever lost. 

Contests can only be edited in the admin panel. Same with contestants of the contests. 

I used supabase, sveltekit, netlify. Took about 90 minutes. Will be doing some more debugging later.
